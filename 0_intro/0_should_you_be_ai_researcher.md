## Should you become an AI researcher?

An experienced software engineer§ asked me if they should become an AI researcher instead. I replied:
You need to figure it out yourself over the next year.

1. Determine the reason you want to be AI researcher?
- For me, I don't care about just making a lot of money and being forgotten in my room, waiting for my life to pass. I belive doing science will have a lot more impact over the long term.

2. Be careful, even if you get an AI researcher job at OpenAI, DeepMind..., you will still do what the company tells you, which might again feel like you are not making a lot of impact - this is why it will take some time for you to figure out what you want to do. Making YouTube videos helps me avoid this problem as I can do whatever I feel is impactful. You can also write a blog like Su Jianlin.

3. Science takes decades. Su Jianlin invented RoPE (method that every LLM company is using) after 12 year of writing blogs.

4. There is not as much moneys in science that will be useful in 50 years as in building a product that will be sold soon. 

5. You will realize internet fame, likes, views from publishing papers are worthless. 
- They don't necessarily mean your research is good. It will be strongly correlated with the hype for LLMs or whatever is currently popular. Papers that get 5 likes today might prove very important in 10 years.
- Internet fame can not replace socializing with real people. You will realize it's an empty surface-level fleeting happiness that disappears as fast as it appeared. If you don't go out and socialze, you will be lonely and sad even if you are the most followed researcher on X (although it does help you make friends in real life since you have a goal, purpose, ability, etc.)

6. You will be working on some specific obscure thing, you will not be center of the attention. You may still be in the center of attention but in a different way in your free time, like hobby travel TikToks.

Knowing this, you can figure out if this is what you want to do. For me it is as I find anything else empty and purposeless.
